                  <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2021 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>
          
                  <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
                  <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
                  <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
                  <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
                  </blockquote>

We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
                  <h3>Example lists</h3>
                  <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>First list item</li>
                    <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
                    <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>First list item</li>
                    <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>
                    <li>Third list item to close it out</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>And this is a definiton list:</p>
                  <dl>

                  <h2>Inline HTML elements</h2>
                  <p>HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>To bold text</strong>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;strong&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li><em>To italicize text</em>, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;em&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li>Abbreviations, like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langage">HTML</abbr> should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, with an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> attribute for the full phrase.</li>
                    <li>Citations, like <cite>— Mark Otto</cite>, should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;cite&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li><del>Deleted</del> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;del&gt;</code> and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ins&gt;</code>.</li>
                    <li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sup&gt;</code> and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;sub&gt;</code>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.</p>

                            <p>
                                Your website is the most important tool for creating a marketable web presence. It is
                                the
                                cornerstone of any online branding strategy. It is your brand’s home on the web and the
                                place that anyone in the world can come to do business with you. You understand this and
                                you have ploughed a fair amount of time and resources into developing a website that
                                generates business for you. But it’s not happening. Why?
                            </p>
                            <h2>Why is your website not generating business?</h2>
                            <p>
                                There are a few reasons why websites fail to convert visitors into customers, leads into
                                sales...
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Content isn’t valuable
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                When a website is created with a design-first approach rather than a content-first
                                approach, it might look fantastic but won’t provide value to users. A website is one of
                                an organisation’s main communication channels. So, it should be maximised as part of the
                                overall marketing strategy, and be aligned with brand messaging as well as current
                                marketing activities. Products, discounts, offers, promotions and other important
                                marketing info should be easily findable on the website.

                                It should be clear to visitors what you want them to do on your website. Whether it is
                                to sign-up for your newsletter, buy something, get information, participate in your
                                community or register for an event – make it clear.

                                Speed is very important. Slow page download times frustrate users, and you lose them.
                                Websites must be responsive, fast to download, work well on poor connections and perform
                                on mobile devices. Many websites load slowly because they weren’t optimised to load
                                faster.

                            <p>
                                You can have the best website on the world wide web, with the best content, but if
                                nobody knows it is there, you’re unlikely to get much traffic. No website traffic
                                ultimately means no website business. Everything that you do from an online marketing
                                perspective is about raising awareness of your website and driving traffic to using
                                Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM) strategies.

                                SEO consists of different strategies, tactics and best practices which conspire towards
                                an end goal of improving your website’s placement by search engines. The closer to the

                                On-page SEO involves everything that you can control on your own website to make it more

                                about site speed (as we have said, this is very important), keyword presence and headers

                            <p>
                                Off-page involves anything that is done on other websites that could influence your
                                website’s rankings. In a nutshell, this refers to links from other sites to yours.
                                Off-page SEO, via quality back links, improves search engine and user perception of your
                                website’s relevance, trustworthiness, credibility and authority.

                            <p>
                                SEM covers a range of paid-for marketing tactics to get your brand, website and content
                                seen by your target audiences. The big advantages of SEM are that it is immediate and
                                guaranteed, unlike SEO which leads to longer term organic growth but takes time and
                                dedication to accomplish. The thing about SEM is that you have to pay for it. SEM
                                encompasses Pay-Per-Click advertising, social media marketing, sponsored social posts,
                                email marketing and promoted content on third-party websites.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                There are many ways in which SEO and SEM efforts complement each other to drive online
                                visibility and website traffic which generate leads and business. You can market your
                                brand or business online by paying for top spots on search engine results pages. It’s a
                                way to get visibility fast and boost marketing qualified leads. However, if the people
                                clicking through to your site are frustrated by slow page downloads, poor quality
                                content and lack of functionality, you could fail at converting them into customers. You
                                need a sound SEO strategy to get organic growth in the visibility of your brand online,
                                and website traffic. Organic growth is longer lasting than that which is paid for. Can
                                you see why SEO and SEM should be combined?

                            <p>

                                Off-page involves anything that is done on other websites that could influence your
                                website’s rankings. In a nutshell, this refers to links from other sites to yours.
                                Off-page SEO, via quality back links, improves search engine and user perception of your
                                website’s relevance, trustworthiness, credibility and authority.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                SEM covers a range of paid-for marketing tactics to get your brand, website and content
                                seen by your target audiences. The big advantages of SEM are that it is immediate and
                                guaranteed, unlike SEO which leads to longer term organic growth but takes time and
                                dedication to accomplish. The thing about SEM is that you have to pay for it. SEM
                                encompasses Pay-Per-Click advertising, social media marketing, sponsored social posts,
                                email marketing and promoted content on third-party websites.

                                Why you should combine SEO and SEM
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                There are many ways in which SEO and SEM efforts complement each other to drive online
                                visibility and website traffic which generate leads and business. You can market your
                                brand or business online by paying for top spots on search engine results pages. It’s a
                                way to get visibility fast and boost marketing qualified leads. However, if the people
                                clicking through to your site are frustrated by slow page downloads, poor quality
                                content and lack of functionality, you could fail at converting them into customers. You
                                need a sound SEO strategy to get organic growth in the visibility of your brand online,
                                and website traffic. Organic growth is longer lasting than that which is paid for. Can
                                you see why SEO and SEM should be combined?
                            </p>
